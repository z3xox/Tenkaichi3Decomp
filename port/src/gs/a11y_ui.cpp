// The settings window (ui.cpp) for a screen reader user: what the D-pad lands on is said through PortA11y_Say
// (gs/a11y.c), and the right stick moves the slider that has the focus without activating it first. Plus the
// Accessibility tab (A11yUi_Tab), with the volumes of the accessibility's own sounds and of the game's voices under it.
//
// How the window is read: between NewFrame and EndFrame, Dear ImGui's own text log (LogToBuffer, the one behind "Log to
// clipboard") takes every piece of text as it is drawn, and the item hooks meant for the Dear ImGui Test Engine
// (IMGUI_ENABLE_TEST_ENGINE, set by port/tools/undefined.py) say where each item starts and ends in it, with its id,
// its window, its kind and its state. So the item under the navigation cursor (g.NavId) has its label and its value,
// and the lines drawn before it are its description. Logging changes nothing on the screen: it only adds to a buffer.
//
// The right stick, left or right, steps the focused slider down or up, and repeats while held. It does it the way the
// D-pad does on an active slider: for that one item, the slider sees itself activated by the controller with D-pad left
// or right just pressed, and all of that is put back as it was right after (push_slider / pop_slider).
//
// Upstream has a reader of its own for these windows (ui_a11y.cpp, from 0.1.39.3): it says the item the focus is on,
// the window and the tab it opens, and the tooltip. This one goes on top of it, not instead: its Dear ImGui hooks are
// that file's, which hands them on here (A11yUi_ItemAdd / A11yUi_ItemInfo), and the texts it says go through tr here
// (A11yUi_Words). In a window it read (upstream_reads), this one says only what it does not: the description lines
// before the item, the column of a table, the slider's hint and the window's closing lines, queued after it. The
// windows after it (the notice), and the right stick, the chat and the Accessibility tab, are this file's alone.
//
// With the accessibility off (PortA11y_On() == 0) none of this runs: no log, no hook, no tab.
//
// Tests without a controller or a screen reader ($BT3_A11Y_LOG has what is said):
//   $BT3_A11Y_UI_KEYS="<frame>:<key>[:<frames>],..."  presses a key from that frame on, for one frame or <frames>:
//                                                     up down left right a b l1 r1, rs- rs+ (the right stick), and
//                                                     toggle (closes or opens the window, as F1 does)
//   $BT3_A11Y_UI_DEBUG=1                              the items and lines of each frame that says something, to
//                                                     stderr (2: of every frame)
