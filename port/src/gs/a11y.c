/*
 * Screen reader output (accessibility): speech and braille through Prism (https://github.com/ethindp/prism,
 * MPL-2.0), loaded at run time from prism.dll (libprism.dylib on macOS, libprism.so elsewhere) in the program's
 * folder. Without that library, and without $BT3_A11Y_LOG, all of this stays off: no thread, no file, no key, nothing
 * said.
 *
 * One speaker for the whole program. port/src/a11y_game.c (the game's thread, once per blank) says what changed on
 * the game's screens; the render thread's event loops pass their events here for the repeat key and button. The
 * library is only called from a thread of its own, so a slow screen reader never holds up a frame.
 *
 * A message either interrupts (it cuts what is being said and drops what is queued) or is queued after the one
 * before. "Repeat" says again the last interrupting message and the ones queued after it.
 *
 *   bt3_settings.txt  a11y=0            off, even with the library there
 *                     a11y_key_repeat   the repeat key, an SDL scancode (default F2); the controller's Select
 *                                       tapped alone (a11y_pad.c) and its touchpad repeat too, except in a fight
 *                     a11y_key_gauges1  the keys that say player 1's and player 2's gauges in a fight (default F3
 *                     a11y_key_gauges2  and F4); in a fight a tap of Select says where the rival is, two taps the
 *                                       player's own gauges, three the rival's; the touchpad click those of the
 *                                       half it is clicked on
 *                     a11y_key_where    the key that says where the rival is (default F5)
 *                     a11y_log=1        the log below, into a11y_log.txt in the program's folder (for a report)
 *                     a11y_cue_volume   the accessibility's sounds in a fight (a11y_tones.c), in percent of a loudness
 *                                       scale (3 dB each tenth): default 60, 0 turns them off
 *                     a11y_voice_rate   on a Mac, the speed of the system's voice the game speaks with: 10 to 100,
 *                                       default 50, the Mac's usual one
 *                     a11y_voice_volume and its volume, in percent of the Mac's: 10 to 100, default 100
 *                     a11y_lang="pt"    the language to speak, a code of two or three letters (default: the
 *                                       system's preferred language)
 *                     a11y_missing=1    out of English, adds each line said without a translation, once, to
 *                                       a11y_untranslated.txt in the program's folder (for whoever translates)
 *   $BT3_A11Y_LOG=<file>                writes what is said, one line each with the blank (tests without a screen
 *                                       reader: the headless build has no library), and notes on what changed on
 *                                       the screen, marked "#"
 *   $BT3_A11Y_ASK=<n>                   asks every n blanks, in turn, where the rival is, player 1's gauges, where,
 *                                       player 2's, as their keys would (tests: without a window no key can be
 *                                       pressed)
 *   $BT3_A11Y_VOICE=1                   the settings window shows the two above without that voice (tests)
 *   $BT3_A11Y_LANG=<code>               the language, over a11y_lang
 *   a11y_<code>.txt                     the lines to say instead of the English ones (see "translations" below);
 *                                       a11y_es.txt comes with the program
 *   a11y_<code>_own.txt                 the player's own lines, which win over those
 *   $BT3_A11Y_MISSING=<file>            the lines without a translation into this file instead, a new one each run
 *
 * The screen reader is chosen by trying them: NVDA, then JAWS, then the others in Prism's order. A screen reader
 * is used only when it starts (prism_backend_initialize), not because it is installed: Prism's own "best" choice
 * took NVDA while NVDA was not running (0.16.5).
 * On macOS the system's own voice (AVSpeechSynthesizer) is tried first instead, as the owner chose (2026-11-02): it
 * queues and can be cut, which VoiceOver's announcements cannot (Prism has no stop for them and joins what comes
 * within 15 ms into one); then the others in Prism's order, VoiceOver among them. That voice has no braille, and it
 * takes the player's speed and volume (a11y_voice_rate, a11y_voice_volume; Prism starts the volume at half). Whether VoiceOver is running is asked apart, for the blind player
 * profile (READER_VOICEOVER). Prism hands that voice's calls to the main thread, which on macOS is the game's
 * (port/src/plat_mem.c) and runs them as it reads its events, once per frame: a frame that takes long delays what
 * is said, it never holds up the game.
 *
 * Prism's version: written against release 0.18.3, the one to put beside the program. Its header is not in the
 * repository; the thirteen functions used are declared below by hand and found by name, and a library without one of
 * them is not used. What a later release could change, and what is done about it:
 *   - PrismConfig growing (it is returned by value, into memory of the caller's): the memory given is
 *     PRISM_CONFIG_ROOM bytes, several times the struct of 0.18.3, and none of its fields is read or written here
 *     but the first byte, its `version`, which goes to the log. It is handed back to prism_init as it came.
 *   - not guarded: a change in the parameters of one of the thirteen functions, in the feature bits or in the ids of
 *     NVDA, JAWS, AVSpeech and VoiceOver; a PrismConfig beyond PRISM_CONFIG_ROOM; prism_config_init no longer
 *     returning the struct by value. None of the functions declared here tells the library's version, so there is no
 *     check of it at load time: with another release than 0.18.3 the line "a11y: prism config version" in the output
 *     is the only sign.

 * notes. Only the hash of the English is needed, so the file need not carry the game's text. A label with numbers or
 * names put in it (%d, %s) keeps them, in the same order, or the English is said. A label that some language says
 * two ways (Spanish "Aleatorio" for a stage, "Aleatoria" for a song) has a second key, the English, a bar and the
 * sense ("Random|song"; trc in a11y_game.c): its line is taken when the file has one, else the plain key's.
 *
 * Every language goes this way, Spanish too: nothing but English is in the code. port/lang/a11y_es.txt has all the
 * labels of a11y_game.c, each key above its line, and is the list to translate from; a release carries it beside
 * the program (port/tools/package.py).
 *
 * Two files are read: a11y_<code>.txt, and a11y_<code>_own.txt, the player's own, whose lines win and which no
 * release replaces: for where the translation of a disc did not reach (the memory card's messages, the main menu
 * guides' lines) or a line one would rather hear another way. Both are looked for in the program's folder; the
 * first also in ../lang/ from there (the repository's port/lang, for a program run from port/build).
 *
 * Either file may also have lines "~word<tab>words": in the game's own lines (not the labels) that whole word is
 * said as the words after the tab. A full stop at the word's end ("~Abbr.<tab>Abbreviation") is taken with the word
 * when one follows it. For a disc whose text abbreviates, or spells a name otherwise than the player wants. */
